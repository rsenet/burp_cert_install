# About Burp Cert Install

## Inject certificate (API <= 23)

Before Android 7.0 (API â‰¤ 23, up to Marshmallow), certificate management was more lenient, making it easier to intercept SSL/TLS requests for debugging purposes with tools like Burp Suite.

In these versions, Android did not strictly separate user-installed certificates from system certificates:

- **Single Certificate Store**: Android relied on a unified certificate store that included both system certificates (pre-installed by the manufacturer or Android) and user-installed certificates.
- **Automatic Trust**: All certificates, whether system or user-added, were automatically trusted by applications unless a specific app explicitly defined a different policy.


## Inject certificate (API < 34)

Since Android 7.0 (API 24 - Nougat), intercepting SSL/TLS requests has become more difficult due to changes in certificate management.

Android Nougat now separates certificate stores into two categories:

- **User Certificate Store**: Contains certificates manually installed by the user (e.g., Burp certificates).
- **System Certificate Store**: Contains certificates provided by the manufacturer or the Android system.

By default, applications only trust certificates from the **System Certificate Store**. This means that user-installed certificates (like those from Burp) are not automatically recognized by applications.

## Inject certificate (>= 34)

In the latest Android 14 release, a change has been made to how the system handles trusted Certificate Authority (CA) certificates.

Previously, these certificates were stored in `/system/etc/security/cacerts/`, a location accessible and modifiable by users with root privileges, allowing immediate system-wide application.

However, with Android 14, the storage location has been moved to `/apex/com.android.conscrypt/cacerts`, a directory within the `/apex` path, which is inherently immutable.
